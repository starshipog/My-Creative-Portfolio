# <My-Creative-Portfolio>

## Description

My motivation to create this website was to display my work and designs to employers.
I built this project so employers and the public are able to preview my work.
This solves the problem of employers wondering what kind of work a potential employee can do.
I learned how to link a webpage to an image.

## Usage

To use this website, there are navigation buttons in the top right area of the header that will take you to which ever section you want to go to. In the work section there are pictures of the websites I built and when clicked on it will take you to the website. At the bottom in the contact section there is a link to my Github.


To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
